Code name "p0rk3r"

Our autonomous code is under the autonomous commands folder in the commands directory. We have two auto modes that are choosen using a smart dashboard widget. The first one just drives forward over a defense. The second one goes under the lowbar, turns, then shoots.

The flipper is a metal bar that pushes the ball into the launcher.
